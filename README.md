# Odd Duck Products Voting App

## Overview

The Odd Duck Products Voting App is an interactive web application that allows users to vote for their favorite products. The products are displayed randomly, and users can click on the product image to cast their vote. After voting on the products, users can view the voting results presented in a table.

## Features

- The application randomly displays three product images for the user to vote on.
- Users can vote for their preferred product by clicking on the product's image.
- The total number of voting rounds can be easily adjusted in the code.
- Once the voting is complete, a "View Results" button appears. 
- Upon clicking the "View Results" button, a table is displayed showing the total votes and views for each product.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript: The main logic of the application is implemented using JavaScript.
- HTML and CSS: Used to structure and style the web page.
- Chart.js (Optional): Initially planned for chart-based visualization of results. This feature can be incorporated as an enhancement.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Start voting by clicking on your favorite product images.
4. After completing the voting rounds, click the "View Results" button to see the results in a table format.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a chart-based result visualization using Chart.js or similar libraries.
- Add a feature to store voting results in local storage to keep track of votes across multiple sessions.
- Enhance the user interface with a more modern design and improved responsiveness.
